### Description

Given the `root `of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

#### Example 1:
![Example1](resources/example1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
![Example1](resources/example2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

#### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
